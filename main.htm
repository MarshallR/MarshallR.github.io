		Hi there! My name is Marshall Rogers. I'm a sophomore web developer, programmer, computer geek, lover of classical music, and incredible romantic (not to mention a master of sarcasm).
		This is my website. It is a hub for my business, which includes web design, functional programming, and computer repair and set-up. Have a look at the ABOUT page for more information on business, and the CONTACT page for information on getting to me.

	<h4>Web Design</h4>
	<p align="justify">
		My philosophy on web design is quite simple. Keep it aesthetically appealing, very functional, and straightforward. Intuitiveness is my call, and I design so that all content can be found by a brand-new site visitor in under 5 clicks. No hiding links or documents, no need for a sitemap, and above all no need for confusion.
		I make a point of keeping a site's style modern and consistent, so that it stays easy-on-the-eyes and doesn't make a visitor want to run screaming like a chicken who's lost his head.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
		I try to keep coding simple and easy for anyone to read. I keep page loading times down by using minimal resources, such as images, lengthy stylesheets, and complicated, over-length scripts. I never use embeds, such as a flash banner or a pointless point-and-click game to keep people entertained.
		I don't use any widgets or code any complicated functions, because quite frankly they bore me.
