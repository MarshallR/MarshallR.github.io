		Hello Internet! My name is Marshall Rogers, and this is my site. It acts as a personal website and a means to communicate for business. 
		If you're wondering my business is computer service, repair, and upgrading in the Waco, Texas area. I can do anything from a basic OS installation to a deep-clean of malware and other harmful software on most machines.
