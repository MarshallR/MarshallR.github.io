not only would she have access to these medicines and devices, but
Hobby Lobby would fund them. That’s right: while White House press
secretary Josh Earnest claims that it “jeopardizes the health of
women,” Hobby Lobby’s health plan pays for 16 different kinds of
contraceptives for its female employees!</FONT></P>

as though it were something extra that Hobby Lobby does. It is not. </FONT></FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style, serif">In
the Left’s fantasy world, the militant Christians at Hobby Lobby
police single female employees to assure that they have not engaged
in sinful, pre-marital sex. As for married women, Hobby Lobby
deprives them of birth control so that each can deliver a new baby
every nine months, for God’s glory, just like in the Old Testament.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style, serif">This
is the most infuriating paragraph for me. It provides one false

The author makes a point earlier about Hobby Lobby providing
(limited) access to birth control. The author emphasized this point
heavily. Then he says (evidently attempting to be quiet about it,
surrounding it with louder words: Glory of God, militant Christians,
sinful, sex) that, yes, Hobby Lobby “deprives them of birth
control”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style, serif">Pick-and-Choose:
You quote mothering and birthing for the ‘Glory of God, just like
in the Old Testament’, yet you do not (No Christian I’ve ever
spoken with on this topic gives this weight) say we should be able to
rape any virgin you want, so long as you pay her father, for the
Glory of God (Deuteronomy 22:28-29: If a man is caught in the act of
raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of
silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he
violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.)</FONT></FONT></P>
